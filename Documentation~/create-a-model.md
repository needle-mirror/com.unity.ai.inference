# Create a model

Use the Sentis API to bring machine learning (ML) models into Unity. You can import models from ML frameworks, create models from scratch, or prepare them for runtime performance.

This section provides information on model workflow, supported model types, and helps you understand how to import, modify, and run models in Unity.

|Page| Description |
|----|-------------|
| [Understand model formats and operators](model-formats.md) | Learn about the supported model types, file formats, functional methods, and operators that Sentis uses. |
| [Export and import a model](export-import.md) | Convert models from machine learning frameworks and import them into Unity in a compatible format. |
| [Transform, optimize, and inspect a model](model-transformation.md) | Prepare your model for runtime with Unity tools. Use these tools to serialize, quantize, encrypt, or inspect the model. |
| [Create or edit a model in Unity](custom-models.md) | Build a model from scratch or modify an existing one directly with Sentis APIs. |
