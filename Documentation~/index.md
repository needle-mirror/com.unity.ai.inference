# Inference Engine overview

Inference Engine is a neural network inference library for Unity. It lets you import trained neural network models into Unity and run them in real-time with your target device’s compute resources, such as central processing unit (CPU) or graphics processing unit (GPU).

Inference Engine supports real-time applications across all Unity-supported platforms.

The package is officially released and available to all Unity users through the **Package Manager**.

> [!TIP]
> Prior experience with machine learning frameworks like [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) or [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is helpful, but not required. It can make it easier to understand how to work with models in Inference Engine.

## Supported platforms

Inference Engine supports [all Unity runtime platforms](https://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Manual/PlatformSpecific.html).

Performance might vary based on:
* Model operators and complexity
* Hardware and software platform constraints of your device
* Type of engine used

   For more information, refer to [Models](models-concept.md) and [Create an engine](create-an-engine.md).

## Supported model types

Inference Engine supports most models in Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) format with an [opset version](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/docs/Versioning.md#released-versions) between 7 and 15. For more information, refer to [Supported models](supported-models.md) and [Supported ONNX operators](supported-operators.md).
