# Upgrade to Inference Engine 2.3

You do not need to take any actions to upgrade your project when upgrading from Inference Engine 2.2. If you are upgrading from Sentis 2.1 please follow the instructions below.

Inference Engine 2.3 makes extensive use of [source generators](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/on-dotnet/c-source-generators). If you're using an older IDE such as Visual Studio 2019, you may need to upgrade to a newer version to continue debugging your project successfully.
