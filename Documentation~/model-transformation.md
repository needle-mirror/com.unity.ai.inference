# Transform, optimize, and inspect a model

After you import a model in Unity, you can apply tools to make it faster, lighter, or more secure.

Use this information to serialize, quantize, and encrypt a model. You can also use built-in tools like the Model Asset Inspector to inspect and debug models.
